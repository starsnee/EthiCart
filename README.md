Did you know that “Between 1990 and 2015, almost 25 percent of Indonesia’s rainforests were destroyed (Sundaraja, et al 2019).” It’s a bleak statistic, but what’s even bleaker is that most people don’t even know that this is mostly due to the palm oil production that takes place there. Oftentimes in our current society, it’s difficult to create minimal harmful impact and make informed decisions when consuming without extensive knowledge or research prior; this is why we created EthiCart. We believe that purchasing power should be returned to the consumer and hope that with more informed decisions, we can easily reach a more sustainable world. 

So… transform your everyday living! EthiCart is a website dedicated to informing the average consumer’s daily purchasing practices, delivered within seconds through a simplistic application in order to create an overall cleaner world. 

EthiCart makes sustainability easily accessible and convenient, at the tip of the fingers as a free mobile app! It’s a simple way to relieve much of the burden and guilt placed upon consumers to purchase ethically on a daily basis. 

The way that EthiCart works is simple and includes plenty of easy-to-use features. We use an application programming interface (API) in order to connect our users with reputable and factual sources through Google Scholar, often linking certain ingredients with articles and published papers. 

Some of our other many features included are item trackers, so our users may include EthiCart into their financial habits. Not only that, we include maps of local farmers and farmers markets, so users have the option to form ethical consumption habits nearby, whilst simultaneously connecting with their own community. Finally, we have a database of “red flag” ingredients and if any product PLU that a user scans includes one of these “red flag” ingredients, it’s immediately flagged and brought to the user’s attention.

Now that you’ve got the run-down of how EthiCart works, let’s see it in action!
